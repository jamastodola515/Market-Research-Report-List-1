<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eculizumab Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plasma Exchange</li><li>Plasma Infusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody used primarily for treating rare blood disorders, operates within two market types: plasma exchange and plasma infusion. Plasma exchange involves the selective removal of patient plasma, replacing it with a substitute to reduce harmful antibodies. In contrast, plasma infusion involves directly introducing donor plasma to boost the patient's levels of essential proteins. Both methods aim to enhance treatment efficacy by managing conditions like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome more effectively.</p></p>
